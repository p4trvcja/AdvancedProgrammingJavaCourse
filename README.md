# Java_projects
## [CV](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/CV_html_json)
The project allows the creation of structured documents, such as CV, with a title, photo, and sections containing paragraphs or lists, with methods to output the document as HTML or JSON and deserialize JSON into a document object.

## [List implementation](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/list_implementation/src)
This project implements a generic list data structure in Java, providing functionalities such as adding elements, removing elements, getting elements by index, checking if the list contains a specific element and more.

## [1D Matrix implementation](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/matrix_and_tests)
This project implements a Matrix stored in the form of a one-dimensional array, providing functionalities for matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and dot product, along with methods for matrix reshaping, getting the shape of the matrix, computing the determinant, inverse, and Frobenius norm. It supports creation of matrices from arrays, generation of random matrices, and creation of identity matrices.

## [Clock GUI with Threads](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/threads_clock)
The project integrates a clock with both console and graphical user interface (GUI) components using Java. It utilizes the LocalTime class to continuously update and display the current time in both textual and visual formats. The console-based clock prints the time, while the GUI-based clock presents the time visually with hour, minute and second hands rotating within a circular layout.

## [Downloading files with Threads](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/threads_download_files)
This project demonstrates parallel downloading of multiple files from URLs using Java's concurrency mechanisms, comparing sequential and concurrent download times.

## [war card game](https://github.com/p4trvcja/AdvancedProgrammingJavaCourse/tree/main/war_card_game)
This program simulates the card game "War" in which two players each draw a card from their deck, and the player with the higher card wins the round.
